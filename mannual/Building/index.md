# A big and very long test header **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)** {#test}

## Requirments: {#requirments}

- packages

* `apt-get update && apt-get install build-essencial cmake`
* `pkg update && pkg install build-essencial cmake`

- a linux device.

* aarch64 **Tested**
* fk others. **NOT TESTED**

- At the end, it's just me trying to learn.

## Build Steps {#buildsteps}

A simple way to build this project is with _cmake_, clone the repository, cd into the root of the _project_ and _run_:

    mkdir build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # =Debug for debug
    cd build
    cmake --build .

for more information goto....idk, _google_ maybe?

Let's make a table just for the sake of it, yeah.

does c++ code block works?

```{.cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "Hello, World! \n";
  std::cout << "Ah! the classic. \n";
  return 0;
}
```

ofcourse it works you twerp, you can see it in treesitter.

Just to check if reference work, hehe.
