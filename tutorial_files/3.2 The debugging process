A general approach to debugging

1) Once a problem has been identified, debugging 
   the problem generally consists of six steps:

2) Find the root cause of the problem (usually the 
   line of code that’s not working).

3) Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring.

4) Determine how you’ll fix the issue.

5) Repair the issue causing the problem.

6) Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed.

7) Retest to ensure no new problems have emerged.
