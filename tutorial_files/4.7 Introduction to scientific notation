scientific notation ->
Numbers in scientific notation take the following form: significand x 10exponent. For example, in the scientific notation 1.2 x 10⁴, 1.2 is the significand and 4 is the exponent. Since 10⁴ evaluates to 10,000, 1.2 x 10⁴ evaluates to 12,000.

For C++ ->
Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter ‘e’ (or sometimes ‘E’) to represent the “times 10 to the power of” part of the equation. For example, 1.2 x 10⁴ would be written as 1.2e4, and 5.9722 x 10²⁴ would be written as 5.9722e24.

For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number 5e-2 is equivalent to 5 * 10⁻², which is 5 / 10², or 0.05. The mass of an electron is 9.1093837e-31 kg.

Significant Digits ->
You ask two people. One tells you the value of pi is 3.14. The other tells you the value of pi is 3.14159. Both of these values are “correct”, but the latter is far more precise.

Here’s the most important thing to understand about scientific notation: The digits in the significand (the part before the ‘e’) are called the significant digits (or significant figures). The more significant digits, the more precise a number is.

Trailing Zeros ->
For numbers with no decimal point, trailing zeros are considered to be insignificant by default. Given the number 2100 (with no additional information), we assume the trailing 0s are not significant, so we drop them:

-> 2100 = 2.1e3 (trailing zeros assumed not significant)

However, if we happened to know that this number was measured precisely (or that the actual number was somewhere between 2099.5 and 2100.5), then we should instead treat those zeros as significant:

-> 2100 = 2.100e3 (trailing zeros known significant)
